sun altar using lua code from sheriff_voting minetest mod
===========

To turn whatever time of day it is to early morning just use something(you can replace paucity:emptymoney with something you want to be used to activate the altar with) on the sun altar and it will activate.

The code is really messy, not cleaned up, but it works so if you are faster than me to clean it up we'll probably see this mod updated sooner than later...otherwise just enjoy the functionality! :)
